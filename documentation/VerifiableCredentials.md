## Running the Aries Agent Locally for Verifiable Credential Testing and Development

**NOTE:** The following process is only necessary when working with Verifiable Credential Testing and Development, and is not necessary for general development purposes. For example, when initially setting up the project.  

To run the project you will need to open two terminals:

- one terminal in the [ngrok](../ngrok) folder: run the [start-ngrok.sh](../ngrok/start-ngrok.sh) script, this will initialize an ngrok tunnel that will be used to forward requests to your agent.

- uncomment `agent` and `wallet` servies defined in [docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml). These must be run through the manage script to populate the required environment variables, and CANNOT be started doing docker-compose up --build alone.

- one terminal in the [moh-prime]root folder: run `./manage start`. This will start all of the services defined in [docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml).

Once started the agent services will be listening on localhost as follows:
- `agent`: http://localhost:8024 (admin API).
- `db` and `wallet` postgres databases will respectively be listening on ports `5432` and `5434`.

You can always run `./manage -h` to get more information about the usage of the script, and refer to it to find values for environment variables being set and consumed by `docker-compose`.

**Please Note:** when starting the project, a `.env` file containing the agent wallet seed will be generated in the [moh-prime] folder. Do not edit this file manually, as its contents are used by the services to persist the agent's information and will be handled automatically by the `manage` script.
