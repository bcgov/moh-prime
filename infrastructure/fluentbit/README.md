# A Sidecar for collecting/processing Logs

[Fluent-bit](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/about/what-is-fluent-bit) is basically a `log forwarder` tool that can be run as a sidecar container (a docker image) in each pod containing our apps, although it can also be deployed as a stand-alone service (servicing multiple apps). Fluent-bit can forward logs to lots of different outputs for example, HTTP, Opensearch, Slack, AWS Lamda and a lot more (see: https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs). The steps required for deploying a Fluent-bit sidecar are shown below. Note: These steps are to deploy the sidecar.

You can read about a common-service-showcase in BCGOV which has deployed a Fluent-bit sidecar for CDOGS node application [here](https://github.com/bcgov/common-service-showcase/wiki/Logging-to-a-Sidecar).

## Implementing Fluent-bit for PRIME application on OpenShift

We deploy a Fluent-bit sidecar container in both backend/webapi and frontend/nginx applications to collect/process/monitor Logs inside the apps and alert the PRIME team if certain keywords, regular expressions, etc. are matched in the log stream. Each release of Fluent-bit comes with a debug version (for example: fluent-bit:2.X-debug) that includes some other Linux tools such as busybox, bash, etc. and make testing the installation easier. In this example, we use `fluent-bit:3.0.3`. We forward alerts to a private Slack channel (a webhook). So our overall flow of logs is: 

`logs from frontend and backend app > fluent-bit sidecar > webhook (Slack channel)`.


### Fluent-bit for frontend/nginx app

Our nginx app outputs logs to a configurable file path (`/tmp/error_flentbit.log`) that can be set in [nginx.configmap](../prime-app-template.yml). Our Fluent-bit container will mount the directory `/tmp/` from nginx app and read the log file `error_flentbit.log`.
Fluent-bit has its own configuration file that we can create using an OpenShift [configmap template](./fluentbit-configmap.yaml. This config of the Fluent-bit uses `tail` plugin in the `INPUT` section to receive logs from nginx log file (/tmp/error_flentbit.log), and uses a `parsers` to define the log formats by providing a Path in the SERVICE section that links to a separate file parser.conf `(Parsers_File  parsers.conf)`. It also uses `grep` plugin in the `FILTER` section to filter logs based on specific keywords (e.g. error). At the end it uses the `SLACK` plugin in the `OUTPUT` section to communicate with our Slack webhook and outputs error notifications to the PRIME Team's Slack channel.

### Fluent-bit for backend/webapi app

Our webapi app outputs logs to a directory (`/opt/app-root/app/logs/`) and the Fluent-bit container will mount this directory to a log-storage path. A [Fluent-bit configmap](./fluentbit-configmap.yaml) with the same configuration is used to read the log files `*.log` from mounted path, filter the log streams based on keyword `ERR` and output the logs to the PRIME Team's Slack channel. 

### create the configmaps for nginx and webapi apps using the [fluentbit-configmap template](./fluentbit-configmap.yaml)

```
oc process -n $NAMESPACE -f fluentbit-configmap.yaml \
  -p NAMESPACE=$NAMESPACE \
  -p OC_ENV=$OC_ENV \
  -p SLACK_ERROR_NOTIFICATION_WEBHOOK=$SLACK_ERROR_NOTIFICATION_WEBHOOK \
  -o yaml | oc -n $NAMESPACE apply -f -
  ```
