#### Git and GitKraken

[Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install the Git version control system, and optionally [download](https://www.gitkraken.com) and install the free GitKraken Git GUI client.

Clone the PRIME repository into a project directory GitKraken or the terminal by typing:

## Building and Running

### Client

To build, run, and open the Angular application in the default browser at http://localhost:4200 for development go to the PRIME project repository in the terminal and type:

```bash
ng serve -o
```

To test the production build locally before pushing features to the repository for deployment type:

```bash
ng build --prod
```

#### Angular CLI Reference

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.x. Refer to the Angular CLI documentation for the available commands, but the most used commands during development will be:

1. `ng serve -o` to serve your application locally in memory during development at `http://localhost:4200` through the default browser, which watches for changes, recompiles, and automatically refresh the application in the browser
1. `ng build` to build the application, which is stored in `/dist` directory.  Use the `--prod` flag for a production build, which significantly decreases the size of the application
1. `ng g <blueprint>` to create code scaffolding for a directive, pipe, service, class, guard, interface, enum, and module
1. `ng lint` to lint the application code using TSLint.
1. `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
1. `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

##### Getting Help

1. To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help`
1. `ng doc component` to look up documentation for features
1. `ng serve --help` to look up doc for `ng serve` command

## Coding Styles

Coding styles should adhere to the [Angular Style Guide](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/style-guide.html) at all times!  The editor config setup for the project will also assist with coding style automatically, as well as VSCode settings.
