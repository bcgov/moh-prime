          <p>
            The person legally responsible for an organization’s PharmaNet use registers the site.

            <app-contextual-help>
              A site must be registered by the organization's Signing Authority. The Signing Authority is responsible
              for PharmaNet use, and can legally bind the organization to the terms of the registration and the
              Organization Agreement for PharmaNet Use.

                Either directly sets up individual PharmaNet access accounts at a site or
                has the authority to request accounts from the site's contracted PharmaNet software vendor. They may,

              <app-contextual-help>
                Under privacy legislation (PIPA and FOIPPA), organizations holding or accessing
                personal information must designate a Privacy Officer, who responds to privacy and information
                management concerns on the organization’s behalf. In the event of a security breach, or concerns with
                how PharmaNet data is accessed or used at the site, the Privacy Officer will be asked to help with
                investigations and provide critical information quickly.

                structure, Internet connections in use at the site, the application(s) used to access PharmaNet at the
                site and security mechanisms such as firewalls and anti-virus measures (generally and at the site).
