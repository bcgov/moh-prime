          Remote access is use of PharmaNet outside your Ministry-approved site.
          <app-contextual-help class="help">
            “Approved Practice Site” means the physical practice site where you provide direct patient care, and which
            is approved by the Province for PharmaNet access. “Approved Practice Site” is never the location (e.g.,
            home) where PharmaNet is accessed remotely. If needed, contact your PharmaNet software vendor for support.
