            Your application will be reviewed by the Ministry of Health. Ensure that the contact information we
            have is accurate and current so staff may contact you if they require more information.

          <p>
            You will be notified once your application has been reviewed. If approved, you will be directed to accept
            the PharmaNet User Access Agreement. Please read the agreement carefully before accepting.
          </p>
          <p>
            After you accept the User Access Agreement, you will receive your PharmaNet ID. Give this ID to the person
            or organization responsible for setting up your PharmaNet access account. This ID must be associated with
            your transactions on any PharmaNet access.
