    To confirm your access, you must accept the PharmaNet User Access Agreement. This agreement is specific to the type
    of access you have. If you request access as a different type of user or for a different type of organization at any
    point in the future, you may be required to accept a different PharmaNet User Access Agreement.

  <p>
    Please read the User Access Agreement carefully, and ensure that you are both willing and able to abide by its terms
    with respect to your use of PharmaNet. You are encouraged to print or save a copy of the User Access Agreement to
    keep for your reference.
