            Your application can be automatically processed. Within a few minutes you should receive approval to access
            PharmaNet once you accept the PharmaNet User Access Agreement. Please read the agreement carefully before
            accepting.
          </p>

          <p>
            After you accept the User Access Agreement, you will receive your PharmaNet ID. Give this ID to the person
            or
            organization responsible for setting up your PharmaNet access account. This ID must be associated with your
            transactions on any PharmaNet access.
          </p>
        </ng-container>


        <p>
          To confirm your access, you must accept the PharmaNet User Access Agreement. This agreement is specific to
          the
          type of access you have. If you request access as a different type of user or for a different type of
          organization
          at any point in the future, you may be required to accept a different PharmaNet User Access Agreement.
        </p>

        <p>
          Please read the User Access Agreement carefully, and ensure that you are both willing and able to abide by
          its
          terms with respect to your use of PharmaNet. You are encouraged to print or save a copy of the User Access
          Agreement to keep for your reference.
