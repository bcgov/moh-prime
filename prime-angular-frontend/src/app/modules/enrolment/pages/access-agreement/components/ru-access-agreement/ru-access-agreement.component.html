  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      <strong>Entire Agreement</strong>. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
      respect to the subject matter of this agreement.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Severability</strong>. Each provision in this Agreement constitutes a separate covenant and is severable
      from any other covenant, and if any of them are held by a court, or other decision-maker, to be invalid, this
      Agreement will be interpreted as if such provisions were not included.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Survival</strong>. Sections 3,4,5(b)(v) (vi), 5(c), 5(d), 6(a)(b)(c)(d)(e), 8, 9, 11, 12, 13(a) (b) (c)
      (d) (e), and any other provision of this Agreement that expressly or by its nature continues after termination,
      shall survive termination of this Agreement.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Governing Law</strong>. This Agreement will be governed by and will be construed and interpreted in
      accordance with the laws of British Columbia and the laws of Canada applicable therein.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Assignment Restricted</strong>. Your rights and obligations under this Agreement may not be assigned
      without the prior written approval of the Province.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Waiver</strong>. The failure of the Province at any time to insist on performance of any provision of
      this Agreement by you is not a waiver of its right subsequently to insist on performance of that or any other
      provision of this Agreement.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Province may modify this Agreement</strong>. The Province may modify this Agreement, including this
      section and the Schedule, at any time in its sole discretion. The Province will publish advance notice of any
      such amendment in its PharmaCare newsletter, which is available on the following website (or such other website
      that may be specified by the Province from time to time for this purpose):

      <a href="http://www.gov.bc.ca/pharmacarenewsletter">www.gov.bc.ca/pharmacarenewsletter</a>

      Any such notice will clearly specify the date upon which the amendment becomes effective (the “Amendment
      Effective Date“). The Amendment Effective Date for any amendment will be at least sixty (60) days after the date
      that the PharmaCare Newsletter that contains the notice is first published.

      If you or a Supervised Person access or use PharmaNet after the Amendment Effective Date, you will be deemed to
      have accepted the related amendment, and this Agreement will be deemed to have been so amended as of the
      Amendment Effective Date. If you do not agree with an amendment for which notice has been provided by the
      Province, you must promptly (and in any event before the Amendment Effective Date) cease all access or use of
      PharmaNet by yourself and all Supervised Persons and terminate this Agreement in accordance with section 10.

      Agreement.
