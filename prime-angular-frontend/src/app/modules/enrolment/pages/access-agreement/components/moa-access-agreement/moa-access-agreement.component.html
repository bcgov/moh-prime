  <p>
    I work in the community health practice under the direct supervision of one or more prescribers who themselves
    have been approved for access to PharmaNet. My employment duties require me to access PharmaNet and information
    from PharmaNet to support the prescribers to deliver direct patient care in the scope of their, and my own,
    professional practice, to individuals whose PharmaNet record I am accessing.
  </p>

  <strong>I hereby acknowledge that I agree with the following statements and undertakings:</strong>

  <ol>
    <li>
      I acknowledge that I may only access PharmaNet to the extent necessary to provide health services to, or to
      facilitate the care of, the individual whose personal information is being accessed, and only in a form and
      manner of access that is consistent with the conformance or compliance standard relating to PharmaNet and any
      other policies or procedures required by the Province.
    </li>
    <li>
      I understand that my access to PharmaNet and use of information from PharmaNet are subject to applicable law,
      including:

        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      I understand that the Province may, in writing and from time to time, set limits and conditions in respect of
      personal information disclosed from PharmaNet and that I must comply with them.
    </li>
    <li>
      I will only access PharmaNet as directed by the prescriber(s) supervising me at the time.
    </li>
    <li>
      I will complete all training required by the Pharmacyâ€™s PharmaNet software vendor and the Province before
      accessing PharmaNet.
    </li>
    <li>
      I will maintain all personal information accessed by me or disclosed to me from PharmaNet in confidence, unless
      I am required to disclose the information

      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          for the purposes of providing direct patient care to individuals whose PharmaNet record I am accessing, or

        <li>
          as otherwise permitted under the Pharmaceutical Services Act.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      I will protect all personal information accessed by me or disclosed to me from PharmaNet by making reasonable
      security arrangements against such risks as unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure or disposal of
      information, files or records containing personal information from PharmaNet.
    </li>
    <li>
      I will not:

          my access to PharmaNet may be suspended or terminated.
        </li>
      </ol>
