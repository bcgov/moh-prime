          <p>PRIME uses the BC Services Card to securely identify people who access PharmaNet. The Ministry of Health
            wants to make sure patient information on PharmaNet is accessed appropriately, only by health professionals
            who have a clinical need to do so.<br/><br/>If you do not have your BC Services Card digital credential set up on your
          mobile device, you will need to do that first. This is a quick process and it usually only takes a few
          minutes!<br/><br/>Visit the BC Services Card website for more information and instructions. </p>
