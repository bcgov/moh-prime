        You need to set up the BC Services Card app to enrol. You will use the app each time you access the eForms
        application. If you have not set up the BC Services Card app, see next screen for instructions.
        If you are not eligible for a BC Services Card, or cannot set up the app, you can submit SA requests by fax.
