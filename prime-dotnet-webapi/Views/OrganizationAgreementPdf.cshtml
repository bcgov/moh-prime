    </li>
    <li>
      PharmaNet contains highly sensitive confidential information, including personal information, and it is in
      the public interest to ensure that appropriate measures are in place to protect the confidentiality and
      integrity of such information. All access to and use of PharmaNet and PharmaNet Data is subject to the
      Act and other applicable law.
    </li>
    <li>
      The Province permits Authorized Users to access PharmaNet to provide health services to, or to facilitate
      the care of, the individual whose personal information is being accessed.

    <li>
      This Agreement sets out the terms by which Organization may permit Authorized Users to access PharmaNet
      at the Site(s) operated by Organization.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    <strong>NOW THEREFORE</strong> Organization makes this Agreement knowing that the Province will rely on it
    in permitting access to and use of PharmaNet from Sites operated by Organization. Organization conclusively
    acknowledges that reliance by the Province on this Agreement is in every respect justifiable and that it
    received fair and valuable consideration for this Agreement, the receipt and adequacy of which is hereby
    acknowledged. Organization hereby agrees as follows:
